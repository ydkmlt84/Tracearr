Tracearr is a streaming access manager for **Plex**, **Jellyfin**, and **Emby** that answers one question: *Who's actually using my server, and are they sharing their login?*

Unlike monitoring tools that just show you data, Tracearr is built to detect account abuse. See streams in real-time, flag suspicious activity automatically, and get notified the moment something looks off.

## What It Does

**Session Tracking** — Full history of who watched what, when, from where, on what device. Every stream logged with geolocation data.

**Sharing Detection** — Five rule types catch account sharers:
- 🚀 **Impossible Travel** — NYC then London 30 minutes later? That's not one person.
- 📍 **Simultaneous Locations** — Same account streaming from two cities at once.
- 🔀 **Device Velocity** — Too many unique IPs in a short window signals shared credentials.
- 📺 **Concurrent Streams** — Set limits per user. Simple but effective.
- 🌍 **Geo Restrictions** — Block streaming from specific countries entirely.

**Real-Time Alerts** — Discord webhooks and custom notifications fire instantly when rules trigger. No waiting for daily reports.

**Stream Map** — Visualize where your streams originate on an interactive world map. Filter by user, server, or time period to zero in on suspicious patterns.

**Trust Scores** — Users earn (or lose) trust based on their behavior. Violations drop scores automatically.

**Multi-Server** — Connect Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby instances to the same dashboard. Manage everything in one place.

**Tautulli Import** — Already using Tautulli? Import your watch history so you don't start from scratch.

## What It Doesn't Do (Yet)

Tracearr v1 is focused on **detection and alerting**. Automated enforcement—killing streams, suspending accounts—is coming in future versions. For now, you see the problems; you decide the action.

## Why Not Tautulli or Jellystat?

[Tautulli](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli) and [Jellystat](https://github.com/CyferShepard/Jellystat) are great monitoring tools. We use Highcharts for graphs too. But they show you what happened—they don't tell you when something's wrong.

| | Tautulli | Jellystat | Tracearr |
|---|---|---|---|
| Watch history | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Statistics & graphs | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Session monitoring | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Account sharing detection | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Impossible travel alerts | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Trust scoring | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Plex support | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Jellyfin support | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Emby support | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Multi-server dashboard | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| IP geolocation | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Import from Tautulli | — | ❌ | ✅ |

Tautulli and Jellystat are platform-locked equivalents—Plex-only vs Jellyfin/Emby-only. If you just want stats, they work fine. If you're tired of your brother's roommate's cousin streaming on your dime, that's what Tracearr is for.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: All-in-One (Recommended)

The supervised image bundles TimescaleDB, Redis, and Tracearr in a single container. No external database required. Secrets are auto-generated on first run.

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.supervised.yml up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and connect your Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby server.

### Option 2: Separate Services

If you already have TimescaleDB/PostgreSQL and Redis, or prefer managing services separately:

```bash
# Copy and configure environment
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
# Edit docker/.env with your secrets (generate with: openssl rand -hex 32)

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Docker Tags

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `latest` | Stable release (requires external DB/Redis) |
| `supervised` | All-in-one stable release |
| `next` | Latest prerelease (requires external DB/Redis) |
| `supervised-next` | All-in-one prerelease |
| `nightly` | Bleeding edge nightly (requires external DB/Redis) |
| `supervised-nightly` | All-in-one nightly build |

```bash
# All-in-one (easiest)
docker pull ghcr.io/connorgallopo/tracearr:supervised

# Stable (requires external services)
docker pull ghcr.io/connorgallopo/tracearr:latest

# Living on the edge
docker pull ghcr.io/connorgallopo/tracearr:nightly
```

### Portainer / Proxmox

For one-click deployment via Portainer or Proxmox, see the ready-to-use compose files in [`docker/examples/`](docker/examples/). These use pre-built images only—no build context required.

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies (requires pnpm 10+, Node.js 22+)
pnpm install

# Start database services
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# Run migrations
pnpm --filter @tracearr/server db:migrate

# Start dev servers
pnpm dev
```

Frontend runs at `localhost:5173`, API at `localhost:3000`.

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui |
| Charts | Highcharts |
| Maps | Leaflet |
| Backend | Node.js, Fastify |
| Database | TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL extension) |
| Cache | Redis |
| Real-time | Socket.io |
| Monorepo | pnpm + Turborepo |

**TimescaleDB** handles session history. Regular Postgres works fine until you have a year of watch data and your stats queries start taking forever. TimescaleDB is built for exactly this kind of time-series data—dashboard stats stay fast because they're pre-computed, not recalculated every page load.

**Fastify** over Express because it's measurably faster and the schema validation is nice.

**Plex SSE** — Plex servers stream session updates in real-time via Server-Sent Events. No polling delay, instant detection. Jellyfin and Emby still use polling (they don't support SSE), but Plex sessions appear the moment they start.

## Configuration

Tracearr uses environment variables for configuration. Key settings:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/tracearr

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here
COOKIE_SECRET=your-cookie-secret-here

# GeoIP (optional, for location detection)
MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY=your-maxmind-key
```
